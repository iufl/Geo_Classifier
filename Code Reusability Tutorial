Build up the solution for a new field

The first step is to create a language model for the specific subject.
The "Build Language Model" file contains an example of how to build a vocabulary for 
solar observations, but in the same way it is possible to train a new language model for
any subject. It connects to Zenodo to get as many papers as possible on the subject.

It is necesary to build up a hierarchical onthology for any specific subject, that
will be added in the "Predefined Labels" file. For a minimal number of changes in the source
code, the hierarchy should follow the rules in the file: start from "themes" related words,
then "domains" and "information"
